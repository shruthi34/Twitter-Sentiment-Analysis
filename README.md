# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

## Performed Twitter Sentiment Analysis using IBM Watson And Spark

## Abstract
Sentiment Analysis is a technique for detecting how the consumer is reacting to a product, brand or even a situation or event either positively or negatively or even neutral. Business, marketing and investment strategists have long been scanning newspapers, industry publications, to read customer’s mind. Sentiment analysis may use a dictionary of words annotated for their arousal and their valence. If a piece of content has more positive keywords than negative keywords then, it is positive content. If a piece of content has more negative keywords than positive keywords then, it is negative content. On basis of some pre-determined keywords such as ”important”, “experienced”, “excellent”, we have to filter data and generate sentiment out of each message. On the basis of collected data we can generate charts to show positive and negative responses.
Twitter is becoming an increasingly popular micro-blogging platform used for financial forecasting and guiding stock market. Over the past few years twitter has moved the stock market with its real time tweets. Hundreds of financial news publications feed twitter with real time views, analysis, and breaking news provided by crowd that is exposed by twitter API making it a “ONE STOP SHOP” and for FREE. 0020Of course this data could be curated and used by organizations for best possible “DATA TO DECISION” approach.
